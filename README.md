# How it works

1. You define notes which trigger based on a matcher ( regex pattern or ai ( not implemented yet ) ) and highlit it your code

2. you have two different commands:
   - display: you can view your configuration and add new ones
   - inFile: you can add new one to your configuration where you see what the regex matches in your current file
